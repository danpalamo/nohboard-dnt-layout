layout for nohboard for us_intl keyboard with modern mouse

![picture alt](https://github.com/danpalamo/nohboard-dnt-layout/blob/master/dnt-us_intl_modernmouse.png "dnt-us_intl_modernmouse.png")

Just a quick layout I slapped together based on the default configs.

I wanted a full US_INTL layout with a 5-button mouse that didn't have scroll left/right.
